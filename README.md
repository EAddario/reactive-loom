# reactive-loom
A simple program to compare the approach and performance of different concurrency models in Java, including [project reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) and [project loom](https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/).

It was partly inspired by [Ivan Vyazmitinov's](https://github.com/ivyazmitinov) excellent series: [Reactiveâ€™s Looming Doom](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2022/09/reactives-looming-doom-part-i-evolution.html)

# Usage

```
mvn clean compile exec:exec
```

Using the command line:

```mvn clean compile exec:exec
mvn clean compile exec:exec

```

The above assumes you are in the root directory of the project.
